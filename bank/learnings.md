- Ownership, Borrowing and Lifetimes have significant impact on how you write and structure
  your code
  - Do functions receive values or references?
  - Are the references mutable?
  - Do we store values or references?
- The goal of ownership is to limit the ways you can reference and change data
- Partially moved values can lead to the same problems as »fully« moved values
